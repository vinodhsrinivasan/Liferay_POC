			<p>This is your Consumer Credit Card Agreement ("Agreement")
				with Credit First National Association, a national banking
				association located at 6275 Eastland Road, Brook Park, Ohio 44142

				account with us ("Account") and includes the following "Related
				Documents":</p>

					or otherwise submitted to request the Account;</li>
				<li>Card Carrier - The card carrier we send with the credit
					card or cards we issue to you;</li>

					provide to you if you make a purchase under a special promotional
					plan; and</li>

				document you sign in connection with the use of your card or
				Account is part of this Agreement. These documents include, but are
				not limited to, your card, Application or any accepted sales slip.
				Participating merchants that may honor your card are not a party to
				this Agreement. Please read this Agreement and keep it for your
				records</p>

			<p>
				<strong>AUTHORIZATION</strong><br /> By signing the application,
				signature capture device or through your electronic consent, you
				certify to each of the following statements: You have read and
				agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this document. You
				are applying to Credit First National Association (CFNA) for a
				credit card with a credit limit up to the amount for which you
				qualify. The application information you provided is true, correct
				and complete, and CFNA may rely on it. You authorize CFNA to obtain
				credit reports about you from consumer reporting agencies in
				considering this application and subsequently for the purpose of
				any update, review, renewal or extension of credit, or reviewing or
				collecting the Account. You understand and agree that by providing
				CFNA with a wireless telephone number, you consent to receiving
				autodialed and prerecorded message calls from CFNA or its
				servicers, its assignees, or its third party debt collectors at
				this number. You understand that if CFNA approves your application,
				CFNA will issue a card and extend credit to you from its offices in
				Ohio. You agree to be bound by the terms set forth in the
				Agreement. You also understand that the Agreement includes an
				Arbitration Section that allows you or CFNA to resolve by
				arbitration claims arising from or related to the Agreement and
				your Account through the American Arbitration Association. The
				Arbitration Section will prevent you and CFNA from having claims
				resolved by a judge or jury and prevent you from participating as a
				representative or member of any class of claimants for claims
				subject to arbitration. Other rights available in court may also
				not be available in arbitration. You can reject the Arbitration
				Section within 30 days after CFNA opens your Account as explained
				in the Agreement. By submitting your application, you acknowledge
				that you have read, understood and received a copy of this document
				and if approved for credit by CFNA, agree to be bound by the terms
				set forth in this document.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>1. DEFINITIONS.</strong><br /> You and your - each person
				who requested an Account approved by CFNA.<br /> We, us and our -
				CFNA or any person or entity to which CFNA sells or gives your
				Account.<br /> Credit Card or Card - each credit card we issue to
				you or a person any of you authorizes to use the Account.<br />
				Authorized User - a person any of you authorizes to use the Account
				and to whom we may issue a Card. Other capitalized terms are
				defined in the Agreement. Defined terms have the same meaning when
				used in your monthly billing statement ("Statement").
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>2. YOUR PROMISE TO US.</strong><br /> You agree to the
				terms of this Agreement. You promise to do everything this
				Agreement requires of you. For joint Accounts, each of you promises
				to do everything this Agreement requires. You specifically promise
				to pay all amounts owed because of transactions made on your
				Account by any of you and any Authorized User. You will be bound by
				this Agreement when you submit an Application that is approved by
				us, sign a sales slip using the Card, or use or permit someone else
				to use credit provided through the Card or Account. You will use
				the Card only for personal, family, or household purposes, and not
				for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes. You agree that
				at any time for any reason we may reissue a Card to you and/or may
				ask you to return any or all Cards.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>3. CREDIT LIMIT.</strong><br /> The Credit Limit of your
				Account is the total maximum amount we allow you to owe us at any
				time. If you exceed any credit limit that we have set for your
				Account, we can still charge you for all transactions, Interest
				Charges and other charges ("Finance Charges") without giving up any
				of our rights under this Agreement. We may increase or decrease
				your Credit Limit at any time at our option. The reasons for
				changes may include, for example, your credit history with us, your
				default under this Agreement (see Section 13 below), fraud
				prevention or changes to this credit card program or CFNA policy.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>4. MONTHLY STATEMENTS; BILLING CYCLES.</strong><br /> We
				will send you a Statement at the end of each Billing Cycle in which
				(a) your Account has a balance of $1 or more, (b) an Interest
				Charge is imposed or (c) applicable law requires us to send a
				Statement. We send only one Statement for your Account each month.
				Each Statement will show, among other things, the date on which the
				most recent Billing Cycle ended (the "Statement Closing Date" of
				the Billing Cycle), Previous Balance, Payments and Credits,
				Transactions, Interest Charges, other Fees and Charges, Payment Due
				Date, New Balance and Minimum Payment Due. A Billing Cycle means
				the days between Statement Closing Dates.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>5. YOUR ADDRESS.</strong><br /> We will consider your
				current address and state of residence to be the same as the
				billing address we maintain in our records. You agree to notify us
				of any change in your name, residence, or billing address by
				writing to us at the address shown on your Statement. Any notices
				required by law shall be deemed received if mailed to your current
				address.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>6. PAYMENTS; MINIMUM PAYMENT.</strong><br /> You may pay
				all of your Account balance at any time without penalty. You must
				pay us at least the Minimum Payment Due for each Billing Cycle by
				the Payment Due Date shown on your Statement. The Minimum Payment
				Due for each Billing Cycle will be the greater of (a) 4% of the New
				Balance (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar) plus all past due
				amounts and any Late Payment Fee, Returned Payment Fee, or unpaid
				ACH Service Fee incurred during the previous Billing Cycle; or (b)
				$19 (or any amount less than $19 needed to pay your Account balance
				in full). The New Balance used to determine your Minimum Payment
				Due includes Regular Credit Plan transactions and Promotional
				Credit Plan balances (see Section 9 below for a description of
				Credit Plans).
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>7. SKIP-PAYMENT OPTION.</strong><br /> At our sole option,
				we may allow you to skip payment of the Minimum Payment Due for a
				certain Billing Cycle. During any Skip-Payment period, Interest
				Charges will continue to accumulate on the unpaid balance of your
				Account, but no Late Payment Fee will be assessed. At the end of
				any Skip-Payment period, the Minimum Payment terms of this
				Agreement that would have applied were it not for the Skip-Payment
				feature, will automatically resume. Taking advantage of the
				Skip-Payment option will not extend the Delay Period for special
				Promotional Credit Plans.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>8. METHODS OF PAYMENT.</strong><br /> Payments received at
				CFNA by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on a business day are credited to
				your Account as of that day. You may pay your Account by mail, by
				telephone or on-line. If paying by mail, send your personal check
				or money order, payable in U.S. dollars, to Credit First N.A. at
				the payment address shown on your Statement. Include your payment
				stub and do not send cash. You agree not to send us any check
				marked "payment in full" or with similar terms or other conditions.
				If you do, the check must be sent to our Dispute Resolution
				Department at a separate address for Inquiries specified on your
				Statement. We can accept such checks or late or partial payments
				without losing our right to receive the full amount owing on your
				Account. If paying by telephone, utilize our automated payment
				system at 800-321-3950. If paying on-line, log on to www.CFNA.com.
				Follow all of the instructions for making a payment specified on
				your Statement. Any payment that does not conform to these
				requirements may not be credited to your Account for up to five
				days, or may be rejected.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>9. CREDIT PLANS.</strong><br /> A. Regular Credit Plan.
				You may use your Account for transactions that may or may not be
				subject to Promotional Credit Plan terms. Any balance of
				transactions not subject to Promotional Credit Plan terms will be
				part of your Regular Credit Plan and treated as your "Revolving
				Balance." B. Promotional Credit Plans. At our option, we may offer
				Promotional Credit Plans. Any Promotional Credit Plan may apply for
				a limited period of time. Our rights and your responsibilities will
				change if you make a qualifying purchase under a Promotional Credit
				Plan. If you participate, the applicable Promotional Credit Plan
				terms will be given to you in a separate document. Promotional
				Credit Plan terms temporarily modify certain terms of this
				Agreement for qualifying purchases, and all other terms of this
				Agreement remain unchanged. Any temporary modification of Agreement
				terms for Promotional Credit Plans will not limit or affect any
				other rights we have under this Agreement or applicable law.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>10. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS.</strong><br /> We apply
				payments first to previously billed Interest Charges; then to your
				purchases. The application of payments may be amended by
				Promotional Credit Terms. Except as otherwise prohibited, we will
				apply payments equal to or less than the required Minimum Payment
				amount and any credits to balances on your Account in a way that is
				deemed appropriate by us. We will also follow the requirements of
				applicable law when allocating your payments.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>11. INTEREST CHARGES.</strong><br /> We will calculate
				periodic Interest Charges on your Account for each Billing Cycle by
				multiplying a monthly periodic rate ("Periodic Interest Rate") by
				the Average Daily Balance (including new transactions) on your
				Account. A Periodic Interest Rate is one-twelfth of its
				corresponding Annual Percentage Rate ("APR"). We will charge you a
				minimum Interest Charge of $1 for any Billing Cycle in which an
				Interest Charge of less than $1 would otherwise be imposed.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>A. Periodic Interest Rate; Interest Rate. </strong>The
				Periodic Interest Rate that applies to your Revolving Balance is
				1.9% (corresponding APR 22.8%) ("Interest Rate").
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>B. How We Calculate Average Daily Balance Subject
					to Periodic Interest Charges.</strong> To get the Average Daily Balance for
				your Revolving Balance, we first must determine the daily balance
				for your Revolving Balance. To get the daily balance, we take the
				beginning Revolving Balance of your Account each day. Then we
				subtract any payments or credits applied to your Revolving Balance,
				and any unpaid Interest Charges. We add to that amount any new
				Regular Credit Plan transactions, Late Payment Fees, credit
				insurance, debt cancellation charges and other Account fees and
				administrative charges. We then add up all the daily balances and
				divide by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us
				the Average Daily Balance for your Revolving Balance. We do not
				charge Interest Charges on unpaid Interest Charges, that is, we do
				not compound Interest Charges.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>C. When Interest Charges Begin to Accumulate.</strong>
				Interest Charges accumulate on each purchase from the later of (a)
				the date of the transaction or (b) the first day of the Billing
				Cycle in which the transaction posts to your Account. However, we
				do not assess Interest Charges in the following circumstances:
			</p>

			<p>1. If you paid the New Balance at the beginning of your
				previous Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date during that previous
				Billing Cycle (or if that New Balance was $0 or a credit balance),
				then:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>if you pay the New Balance on your current Monthly
					Statement in full by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing
					Cycle, we will not impose Interest Charges on Purchases during
					your current Billing Cycle, and</li>
				<li>if you make a payment that is less than the New Balance by
					the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will credit
					that payment as of the first day in your current Billing Cycle.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>2.If you had a New Balance at the beginning of your previous
				Billing Cycle and you did not pay that New Balance by the Payment
				Due Date during that previous Billing Cycle, then we will not
				charge Interest Charges on any Purchases during the current Billing
				Cycle if you pay the New Balance at the beginning of your current
				Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing
				Cycle.</p>

			<p>
				<strong>12. FEES.</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>A. Late Payment Fee.</strong> If we do not receive at least
				the Minimum Payment Due by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on your Payment
				Due Date we may add to your Account a Late Payment Fee of $15 if
				your New Balance is less than $100, $25 if your New Balance is $100
				or more, and $35 if your New Balance is $100 or more and you did
				not make at least the Minimum Payment by the Payment Due Date in
				each of the six prior Billing Cycles. However, the Late Payment Fee
				will never exceed the amount of your required Minimum Payment to
				which the Late Payment Fee relates. Any Late Payment Fee assessed
				will be added to the Revolving Balance on your Account.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>B. Returned Payment Fee.</strong> If your payment check,
				ACH, electronic debit or other instrument is dishonored by your
				bank or must be returned for any reason, we will add a Returned
				Payment Fee of $25, or $35 if you had a returned payment in any of
				the 6 prior Billing Cycles, to the Revolving Balance of your
				Account. However, the Returned Payment Fee will never exceed the
				amount of your most recent required Minimum Payment.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>C. ACH Service Fee.</strong> Each time you ask a customer
				service representative to assist you in making an expedited
				automated payment from your bank account (i.e. an automated
				clearinghouse or "ACH" transaction), when permissible, we may add a
				service fee to the Revolving Balance of your Account. The amount of
				the fee will be disclosed at the time you request the service.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>13. DEFAULT.</strong><br /> Your Account will be in
				default if you fail to do something that this Agreement requires of
				you, subject to any restrictions under applicable law. If that
				happens, we may tell you to pay us immediately everything you owe
				under the Account and applicable law. We will tell you in advance
				and/or give you an opportunity to cure your default only if
				applicable law requires us to do so.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>14. LOST OR STOLEN CARD OR IDENTITY THEFT.</strong><br />
				If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or a possible
				unauthorized use of your card (including suspected identity theft),
				you should write to us immediately at CFNA, BK-11/Customer Service,
				P.O. Box 81315, Cleveland, Ohio 44181-0315 or call us at
				800-321-3950. You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that
				occurs after you notify us. You may, however, be liable for
				unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case,
				your liability will not exceed $50.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>15. HOW TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.</strong><br /> You (either
				of you if more than one) may cancel your Account at any time. Cut
				each Card in half and send us the pieces with a letter telling us
				you want to cancel your Account. This includes each Card you gave
				to others. Send us the letter and Card pieces at the address shown
				on your Statement. You still must pay the full amount you owe us.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>16. WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.</strong><br />
				We may cancel your Account and Cards at any time for any reason.
				Any Card issued for your Account must be cut in half and the pieces
				sent to us if we ask. This includes each Card you gave to others.
				You cannot use a Card after we ask you to return it. You still must
				pay the full amount you owe us, and this Agreement will continue to
				apply to any unpaid balance.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>17. CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS.</strong><br /> We will
				authorize all Account purchases in advance. A merchant may ask you
				to provide identification. We may not be able to authorize a
				transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit, for
				example if our authorization system is not working or if we suspect
				possible fraud. We will not be liable to you if this occurs. We may
				not authorize a transaction if your Account is over your Credit
				Limit or delinquent; if we authorize such a transaction, we do not
				consider it to be an increase in your Credit Limit. We are not
				responsible if any merchant refuses to accept or honor your Credit
				Card.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>18. CREDIT INVESTIGATION AND CREDIT REPORTS.</strong><br />
				You hereby authorize us to investigate your credit record. You
				agree that a credit report may be requested in connection with the
				processing of an application for credit, and subsequently in
				connection with any extension of credit, or any consideration of an
				increase to your credit limit, or any renewal or update of your
				Account, or to take collection action on the Account, or to
				investigate disputes regarding the Account. You also authorize us
				to furnish information concerning the status and payment history of
				your Account to credit bureaus and other creditors. If you believe
				that we have reported inaccurate information about you to a credit
				reporting agency, please contact us at CFNA, BK-11/Customer
				Service, P.O. Box 81315, Cleveland, Ohio 44181-0315. In doing so,
				please provide your Account number, name, address, phone number,
				any other supporting documentation and specify the inaccurate
				information and tell us why you believe it is incorrect. If you
				have a copy of the credit report that includes the inaccurate
				information, please send a copy of that report to us as well.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>19. PHONE CALLS.</strong><br /> You authorize us, or our
				servicers, assignees, or third party debt collectors to contact you
				by telephone about your Account. You agree that we may call you
				about your Account using an automatic dialing - announcing device
				and that these calls will not be "unsolicited" calls for purposes
				of state or federal law. You understand and agree that by providing
				us with a wireless telephone number, you consent to receiving
				autodialed and prerecorded message calls from us or our servicers,
				assignees, or third party debt collector at that number. From time
				to time, we may monitor and/or record telephone calls between you
				and us to assure the quality of our customer service. You agree
				that monitoring and/or recording may be done and that no additional
				notice to you or additional approval from you is needed.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>20. GOVERNING LAW.</strong><br /> This Agreement and your
				Account are governed by federal law applicable to a national bank
				and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of Ohio,
				without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. This is the law
				we mean when we refer in this Agreement to a term that may be
				permitted or required by applicable law. We have accepted this
				Agreement in Ohio.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>21. RESPONSIBILITY FOR GOODS AND SERVICES.</strong><br />
				We are not responsible for the goods and services purchased with
				the Credit Card. You agree to settle all disputes arising from
				purchases directly with the merchant who honored the Credit Card
				and, except as required by applicable law, to pay us all amounts
				required by this Agreement despite such disputes. You agree to
				notify us within 30 days after the occurrence of an event giving
				rise to a product or service dispute.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>22. WAIVER.</strong><br /> We may, at our discretion from
				time to time without notice, waive any of our rights under this
				Agreement in certain circumstances. We can waive our rights without
				affecting our other rights. If we waive any right, we do not waive
				the same right in other circumstances or at other times.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>23. SEVERABILITY.</strong><br /> If any provision of this
				Agreement is finally determined to be unenforceable under any law,
				rule, or regulation, all other provisions of this Agreement will
				still be valid and enforceable.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>24. ASSIGNMENT OF ACCOUNT.</strong><br /> We may sell,
				assign or transfer your Account or any interest we hold in your
				Account without notice to you. You may not sell, assign or transfer
				your Account.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>25. CHANGE IN TERMS.</strong><br /> We may change the
				terms of this Agreement at any time, and we may add or delete terms
				in this Agreement. These changes may include, for example, Interest
				Charge rates, fees and this Change in Terms provision. We will give
				you notice of any change as required by applicable law. Any change
				will apply on and after its effective date to new transactions and
				existing balances on your Account, except as limited by applicable
				law.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>26. DEBT CANCELLATION.</strong><br /> Your purchase of any
				debt cancellation product that we offer is optional. Whether or not
				you purchase this product does not affect our decisions about your
				credit. The Debt Cancellation Terms of any debt cancellation
				product that we offer and you elect to purchase, and any other
				related disclosures, are provided separately from this Agreement.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>27. ARBITRATION.</strong><br /> For purposes of this
				Arbitration Section, the terms "we," "us" and "our" refer to Credit
				First National Association, its parents, wholly or majority owned
				subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, assigns,
				employees, officers and directors. If either you or we choose
				arbitration, neither you nor we will have the right to litigate
				that claim in court or to have a jury trial on that claim, or to
				engage in pre-arbitration discovery, except as provided for in the
				arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").
				In addition, you will not have the right to participate as a
				representative or member of any class of claimants related to any
				claim subject to arbitration. The arbitrator's decision will
				generally be final and binding. Other rights that you would have if
				you went to court may also not be available in arbitration. It is
				important that you read the entire arbitration provision carefully
				before accepting the terms of this Agreement.
			</p>

			<p>A "Claim" is any pre-existing, present, or future claim,
				dispute, or controversy of any kind (including but not limited to
				constitutional, statutory, regulatory, common law, contract, tort
				and equitable claims) arising from or relating to (a) the credit
				offered or provided to you or requested by you, (b) the actions of
				you, us or third parties, or (c) the validity or meaning of this
				arbitration provision and every other provision in this Agreement.</p>

			<p>
				You agree that either you or we can choose to have any Claim
				resolved by binding arbitration. <strong>You and we
					acknowledge that each waives the right or opportunity to litigate
					a Claim in a court of law, and that each agrees to resolve any
					Claims arising out of this Agreement through binding arbitration.</strong>
				This Section does not apply to any of our regular Account
				collection efforts. If this Section (or any part of it) is
				determined invalid or illegal under any applicable statute or rule
				of law, it will be deemed omitted without affecting any other
				provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
				effect.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>There shall be no authority for any Claims to be
					arbitrated on a class action basis.</strong> An arbitration can only decide
				our or your Claim and may not consolidate or join the claims of
				other persons who may have similar claims.
			</p>

			<p>
				Any arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the AAA's
				rules applicable to consumer disputes. For additional information
				go to: <a href="http://www.adr.org/">http://www.adr.org/</a> Any
				arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in the federal
				judicial district where you reside. At your request, we will
				advance the first $250 of the filing and hearing fees for any Claim
				you may file against us; the arbitrator will decide whether we or
				you will ultimately pay those fees. This arbitration agreement is
				made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and
				shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections
				1-16. The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law
				consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes
				of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at
				law. This arbitration provision shall survive repayment of your
				extension of credit and termination of your Account.
			</p>

			<p>Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of law of
				competent jurisdiction.</p>

			<p>

				<strong>YOUR BILLING RIGHTS - KEEP THIS DOCUMENT FOR
					FUTURE USE.</strong><br /> This notice tells you about your rights and our
				responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement</strong><br />
				If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at
				CFNA, BK-11/Customer Service, P.O. Box 81315, Cleveland, Ohio
				44181-0315.
			</p>

			<p>In your letter, give us the following information:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Account information: Your name and account number.</li>
				<li>Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.</li>
				<li>Description of problem: If you think there is an error on
					your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe
					it is a mistake.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>After we finish our investigation, one of two
					things will happen:</strong>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount
					in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.</li>
				<li>If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to
					pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and
					fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the
					date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you
					do not pay the amount we think you owe.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is
				wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you
				still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as
				delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your
				bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you
				as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the
				matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the
				rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you
				question even if your bill is correct.</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Your Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your
					Credit Card Purchases</strong><br /> If you are dissatisfied with the
				goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card,
				and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the
				merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount
				due on the purchase.
			</p>

			<p>To use this right, all of the following must be true:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>The purchase must have been made in your home state or
					within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase
					price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are
					necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed
					to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or
					services.)</li>
				<li>You must have used your credit card for the purchase.</li>
				<li>You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>If all of the criteria above are met and you are still
				dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at CFNA,
				BK-11/Customer Service, P.O. Box 81315, Cleveland, Ohio 44181-0315.</p>

			<p>While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed
				amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we
				will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an
				amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.</p>

					<strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR
						OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT</strong><br /> To help the government fight the
					funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law
					requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record
					information that identifies each person who opens a new account.
					What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for
					your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will
					allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's
					license or other identifying documents.
